    <p>This was a project started by Aaron Wisner and Matan Silver just as a project to keep us busy as 2nd semester senior year high schoolers. The entire site is hand coded in HTML, PHP, CSS, and mySQL. We even host our own web-server. Aaron is in charge of the back-end functionality, 
    and Matan is responsible for the front-end. Currently, this site is in beta, so we are far from complete in development. We will will add a lot more. Exspect weird visual formatting, and perhaps occasional functionality problems; these will get worked out as time progresses.</p>

    <p>Knowing how many high schoolers want a job and many Lexington parents want to find a non sketchy tutor for his/her kid, we devised this site to connect tutors with students needing tutoring. Especially for younger kids, we don't think
    parents should have to pay $100 an hour to get someone to tutor their kid in basic Algebra, any competent high schooler can not only do it cheaper, but can connect much more with the student they are tutoring.</p>

    <p>Please leave us suggestions, feedback, and bug reports by sending us a message through out contact form.</p>
